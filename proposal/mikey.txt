review/summary: A Rock &amp; Roll Fable
review/text: This is an intense film that really draws you in, Walter Hill(48 HRS.) directed this &amp; it shows, the film begins at a concert that is about to get underway, once it does, you actually feel as if your in attendence, Diane Lane absolutely shines as the lead singer, the opening song is fast-paced &amp; powerful as Lane is convincing in her performance, this film is reminicent of the 50's in that a motorcycle gang led by a younger Willem Dafoe, is on the prowl to kidnap Lane &amp; succeeds by crashing her concert, the film then progresses to the opening where we are introduced to Michael Pare' as Lane's former boyfriend who is hired by her manager Billy played by Rick Moranis who looks as geeky as ever, to get her back, Pare' is still smitten with Lane but stubborn about their seperation, he later teams with a two-fisted hellraiser in the form of Amy Madigan who helps him get Lane, they soon head that way, Willem Dafoe who would later go on to superstardom is perfectly cast as Raven who apparently has a crush on Lane, the obvious reason for kidnapping her, Pare' &amp; Madigan soon storm his place &amp; retrieve Lane, Pare' &amp; Dafoe soon meet face to face in which Dafoe declares that Pare' is a dead man, this could easily be a movie about motorcycle gangs, but Hill avoids making it to obvious, there is love overtones with Lane &amp; Pare' who have great chemistry, you almost want them back together, but know it won't likely happen, the showdown between Dafoe &amp; Pare' is neat in itself, the music here is awesome with a 1950's feel &amp; 80's sound, Lane's closing song is powerful in that it catches the attention of Pare', you know he still loves her but can't be with her simply because it is not his style, Dan Hartman's &quot;I can dream about you&quot; is here as her opening act, I finally got this on DVD &amp; it is awesome, it is the best picture of this movie that I have seen, although many cast members went on to bigger things Pare' however never got better films, best known as Eddie in &quot;Eddie in the Cruisers&quot;, his last best known role was Sandra Bullock's cheating husband in &quot;Hope Floats&quot; in which he has maybe 10 minutes of screen time, Pare' is really an under rated actor that like many never got a fair chance, hopefully he will make a comeback.

review/summary: Keeps you guessing, even now!!!
review/text: After reading user MOUSEENEER'S review, boy am I glad I didn't wait for the uncut version, although I had it on Laserdisc, I didn't feel like it added that much more scope to the film, the only thing that is different is the murder scene at the beginning is a little more graphic, Michael Douglas & Sharon Stone's sex scene is a little more revealing,(he performs oral sex on her that is quite vivid), other than that this film is the same as the R-version,this is one hell of a psychological roller-coaster ride, but it is a good one, it may be perceived as a sex movie, but it is a police thriller that keeps you guessing till the end, & still your not sure who the killer is, it has been said in the media that Douglas & Stone hated each other on this film(that they could not get along)although you can't tell by watching, it would not be hard to believe, given the ego's of both Douglas & Stone, despite this, it is a very good police thriller that should not be ignored, & Sharon Stone looks her best here, I can't honestly say now, since she cut off her long blond hair(not wise)but here she shines as Catherine Trammel, a role that Julia Roberts turned down,Stone is perfect here & this will always be her best role.

review/summary: Reynolds comes up with a winner here!!
review/text: Like his pal Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds tried his hand at directing & does a pretty good job here, In this he is Sharky, a vice detective who is after a drug & prostitution kingpin played by Victor Gassman, while pursuing the case, he is soon spying on one of Victor's high priced call girls(Rachel Ward), hoping for a lead, but soon begins to be smitten with her, he soon discovers a local politician who is campaigning to be a Senator is involved with not only her, but Victor as well, this complicates things as Victor soon has his deranged coke-addicted brother(Henry Silva in a chilling role) kill what seems to be Ward in an effort to blackmail the Senator into a agreement, it is Ward's friend who is killed instead as Reynolds soon discovers & takes Ward to a safe place where they begin to fall for one another, one of the best scenes is Reynolds confrontation with Victor, in which we see Victor taunt Reynolds in such a way as he tells him that he owns him & the whole police force & Reynolds responding back about how he plans to rid his town of his kind is powerful to say the least, what makes this film work is the realism of it all, with Reynolds as the underdog taking on a big kingpin, who has much power & influence that Reynolds can only trust those close to him as he has his own team of cops to help him, Ward & Reynolds share a unique chemistry & we learn why Victor has such a hold on her, Henry Silva is at his best as Victor's coke-addicted brother who can as a result of his addiction take several gunshots & keep going is chilling, as Reynolds & his team take Silva on, Reynolds proved that he could be more than the "Bandit" here & in the little seen 1985 film "Stick" as well, but his career went south do to personal problems in his personal life, but made a comback in 1997's "Boogie Nights" & should have won on Oscar night, but this one is a good police drama that is rarely seen in today's Hollywood, & should be rereleased in a widescreen format on DVD, but for now, it is a keeper!!

review/summary: Great 70's Nostalgia
review/text: This was by all accounts a fun show, as a 1979 mid-season replacement & coming on the heels of 1977's "Smokey & the Bandit", one can see why it did so well , it was not a show to be taken seriously, the pilot episode "One armed Bandits" is probably the best, shot in Georgia, which really shows by the way, unlike future episodes shot on the backlot of Warner Bros, this particular episode shows a more serious side to the Duke saga, Bo & Luke are not the cartoon characters they became later, they both have an edge to them, as well as questionable practices, such as Bo's comment to Luke that one of the kids at a nearby orphange could be his, or Daisy who comes off as not so innocent, or Uncle Jesse who has an edge to him not seen in later shows, Roscoe P. Coltrane who later became a bumbling idiot is a hard-nosed sherriff, very reminisent to Jackie Gleason's Buford T. Justice in "Bandit" who justify's his actions regarding his lost pension, & Boss Hogg in this episode acts more like a politican & not the cartoon character he would become, the first season was great, & highly recommended for those who liked the edgyness this show had at first, but by the time you get to the 12th & 13th episode, you can see the edge slipping away, the second season was mired by controversy though, with James Best(Roscoe) protesting the direction of his character(wonder why??) & Ben Jones(Cooter) protesting over his character's appearance(they wanted a clean cut Cooter) to Sonny Shoyer(Enos) possible spin-off show, not to mention the writers & actors strike in 1980 that kept one of the best two-part episodes "Carnival Of Thrills" out of season 2, where it rightfully belongs, hope this is on the season 2 set said to be slated later in the year, if so, 1 & 2 are the only seasons to get, the rest that followed were not as good, & are in my view nothing but a cartoon cutout, like many shows, the direction was changed & the outcome a joke to many viewers & critics, they should have kept the edge, but they didn't & screwing John Schieder(Bo) & Tom Wopat(Luke) out of their royalties was the death knell for this show, highly recommend season 1 & 2 though!!!, but that is about it!! unless you like the cartoonish stuff, I would stop at season 2!!!

review/summary: Better than most say!!!
review/text: Like many, I am a fan of both the "Predator" films & the "Alien" films, with the exception of "Reserection" which of course played like a slasher movie, this one brought back the suspense element so missing in that one, why so many trash it, I don't understand, yes, maybe it should have been longer, but it delivered the goods nonetheless, It definately can be considered a sequel to the "Predator" films & prequel to the "Alien" films, I think I have figured out why so many dislike it, my take from reading many reviews here, are the fact that many see continuity issues as their reasons for disliking it, there are maybe one or two, that I noticed, but that is it, most recent complaints are below that can be clarified such as>>>Lance Henrickson playing Charles Weyland, Bishop's creator, this makes sense, seeing that this is the company Ripley from "Alien" worked for, & that Weyland Industries Inc. terraformed the planet Lv426 in "Aliens", & that Bishop is an android of Weyland, as for Henrickson's human appearance in "Alien 3" this could very well have been Weyland's great grandson, it is never said that Weyland didn't have offspring prior to his demise.Many have complained that the Predators only come every 100 years, so therefore it contradicts the "Predator" films, not so, if you pay attention, the Predators come every 100 years for a rite of passage, this however doesn't mean they don't come to hunt for sport as seen in the other films, nowhere are we told the Predators are picky about their hunting climate, the Predators are hunters plain & simple, no matter what climate, hunting the aliens is a rite of passage, hunting humans for sport, there is a difference you know.As for the aliens on earth, well Antarctica is a believable scenario, not exactly a booming town with people you know, & it sort of sets up the "Alien" films, especially when you consider the "Company's obsession with capturing a specimen even at the expense of their own employees, how did they know what it was the Nostronmo crew had, this film helps explain that a bit better, remember Ash in "Alien" was an android created by Weyland's company who protected it.Many have complained about the inpregnation time period being short, if you remember in "Alien" Kane's inpregnation period happened awful fast too, time is never clarified in that one or this one.Many complain about the surviving Predator teaming up with the lone human survivor as being contradictory, not so, if you remember, the Predators at the end of "Predator 2" show a mutual respect for Danny Glover's character as a show of sportsmanship for defeating one of their own, why wouldn't they here for defeating an alien?.Many say a Pyramid in ancient times could not exist in Antacrtica because it froze before humans, how do we know? we can't, & do we really know what lays beneath Antarctica, I think not.& the reason the aliens never make it to society on earth is simply because the Predator nukes them all, & the survivor (Sanaa Lathan) could have easily told Weyland Inc. about her experiences & they would likely keep it quiet, but yet they knew in "Alien" what the Nostronmo crew had, that is why Ash protected it even though it was killing the crew.As for the Queen surviving in the Pyramid, remember, she was frozen, as for there being more aliens than hosts, how do we know many of them were not frozen with her 100 years ago, we don't, there is nothing to suggest otherwise.The only place I see inconsistency that no one seems to notice is the Predator's inpregnation, the Queen throws her tail into him, this does contradict "Alien 3" when an alien refuses to kill Ripley because of her inpregnation, the Queen would not have done this, & like one reviewer noted, the arriving Predators would have inspected their fallen one before allowing it into their ship, this is the only flaw aside from the Predators being so easily defeated by the aliens, other than this, this one stays overall consistent, I just requires you to think a bit.

review/summary: Mel & Goldie have fun here
review/text: The 1 star reviews make me wonder what people were expecting with this one, It is clear Mel & Goldie had a blast making this film, it really shows, In this Mel is Rick Jarman, a man who has been in the witness protection program for years for testifying against two crooked DEA agents (David Carradine & Bill Duke(Predator) years ago, Carradine is paroled & looking for payback & Rick's contact has retired leaving him to depend on another "Witness" agent who has sold him out to Carradine, Goldie's character is a former love interest of Rick who accidently spots him & gets caught up in his mayhem as he is shot at & chased by Carradine & Duke, what follows is good old fashion fun as Mel & Goldie reconnect under dire circumstances, there are many sight gags here, the motorcycle chase, plane sequence, the hotel rooftop scene, & lastly the zoo sequence that I don't think have been repeated since, overall a fun movie & very reminicent of director John Badham's follow-up movie " The Hard Way" a year later, although critics trashed it in 1990, it was a big hit, I remember the theatare being packed, wihch surprised me giving that this one had serious competition in 1990>>("Back to the Future III", "Pretty Woman", "Die Hard 2", "Gremlins 2", "Dick Tracy", "Another 48 Hours", "The Hunt for Red October", "Days of THunder" & "Ghost", & yet this one still made money, If you are a fan of Mel & Goldie" this is a must see!!
